# Village_Attack_Game
A simple game created as an assignment for OOP subject.

I have chosen Kotlin language because it's not Java :)

My goal was to complete the task using as much various programming techniques as possible.
Some worth mentioning are:
  - Factory design pattern
  - Singleton design pattern
  - Constraint programming (Choco Solver)
  - Java-style multithreading
  - Kotlin-style asynchronous coroutines
